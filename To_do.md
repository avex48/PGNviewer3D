I'm not a programmer and this program is the result of my passion and experimentation.  
I'd like someone to improve my **spaghetti code**.
The most important things to do are:

- Convert the Bash **pgn_gui** script (*which only works on Linux*) into a cross-platform application
- Improve the **HUD** interface and make the application **multi-language**
